This code is a python scripts that generates python bindings for the main functions of CAMB,
the Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background.  See http://camb.info for more details on CAMB.

The python language can let you more flexibly and easily vary the parameters of CAMB, exposed by this code.  You can easily modify which variables are accessible.  For example, if you have modified CAMB to add a new parameter, you can easily add it to pycamb.


Pre-requisites
--------------

1) CAMB.  

This version of pycamb is designed for the January 2010 of CAMB, but unless the code changes significantly 
it will probably continue to work for later versions.  

Please download CAMB and uncompress it to the camb/ folder -- just like the way it is done in extract_camb.sh.

2) Python

This comes pre-installed on most systems these days.  You need a version 2.5 - 2.7 (not version 3 yet).  
If you need a newer version it can be found in most package managers on linux, or built very easily from source.

3) Numerical python (numpy)

This python package can be installed by package managers on linux or easily from source.  
I do not know how old a version will still work with this code, but there's no harm in going for something recent.  
This code was built for 1.8.1.If you update this you will need to rebuild pycamb.

Check Python and numpy are both correctly installed by running

> python
# Some text about the python version will appear.
>>> import numpy

Also check that the installation of numpy has put the utility f2py on your path.  

> which f2py

4) Optional

If you want to plot your results quickly and easily, install the matplotlib python package.


Building
--------
First extract the CAMB source code to camb/

> bash extract_camb.sh

Second, compile and install pycamb.

> python setup.py install --user
or 
> python setup.py install --inplace

Check if the installation has worked correctly using:

> python

>>> import pycamb

If no error messages are reported, pycamb has been built correctly.


Using
-----
To invoke camb, a lot of parameters (omega[b,c,v,n], etc) has to be provided. We collect these parameters
into a PyCamb object.

See http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rainwoodman/pycamb/blob/master/Example.ipynb
For an example.

> from pycamb import PyCamb
> help(PyCamb) # a list of supported parameters with their default value,
               # documentation and corresponding CAMB variable names.
> camb = PyCamb(n_s=0.971)
> camb['WantTensor'] = True
> print camb # a list of supported parameters with their current value.

The functions currently available in the code are:
    
PyCamb.camb             #Get CMB power spectra; returns T,E,B,X
PyCamb.matter_power     #Get P(k); returns k,P(k)
PyCamb.transfers        #Get transfer functions; returns k,T_i(k,z),sigma8(z)
PyCamb.age              #Get age of universe at z=0
PyCamb.angular_diameter #Get angular diameter distance to given redshift

All of them are called in a similar way; 

> python
>>> from pycamb import PyCamb
>>> help(PyCamb)
>>> camb = pycamb.PyCamb(H0=72, n_s=0.95)
>>> T,E,B,X = camb(2000)
>>> k, p = camb.matter_power(z=[159])

NB: CAMB requires redshift parameters to be in order from high to low. PyCamb works around
this requirement. However we can only do at most 500 redshifts; a workaround is possible but
we have not implemented it yet.

Bugs & Issues
-------------
If you get any weird errors in your scripts about indentation, check whether you have mixed tabs 
and spaces somewhere.

There may be memory leaks from CAMB when an exception is raised.
